# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains the Requirement Analysis phase for a Booking Management System. It shows how requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and validated to create a clear blueprint for software development.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software system needs to do. It helps developers and stakeholders agree on **what features the system should have** and ensures the final product meets user needs.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Defines Project Scope** – Helps prevent adding unnecessary features (scope creep).  
2. **Clarifies System Requirements** – Reduces mistakes during development.  
3. **Aligns Stakeholder Expectations** – Ensures everyone agrees on what the software will do.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

- **Requirement Gathering** – Collecting needs from users and stakeholders.  
- **Requirement Elicitation** – Asking questions, holding interviews or workshops to refine requirements.  
- **Requirement Documentation** – Writing clear specifications and use cases.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling** – Organizing and understanding the requirements.  
- **Requirement Validation** – Checking with stakeholders that requirements are correct and complete.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These define **what the system should do**. Examples for our booking system:  
- Users can search for properties.  
- Users can register and log in.  
- Users can book a property.  

### Non-Functional Requirements
These define **how the system should behave**. Examples:  
- Page load time should be under 2 seconds.  
- The system should be secure.  
- The system should handle 1000 users at once.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are conditions that **must be met for a feature to be considered complete**.  

**Example:** Checkout Feature  
- Users can complete a booking with valid payment details.  
- Users receive a confirmation email after booking.  
- The system prevents checkout if payment fails.
